            <p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of our customer page is to provide CCN employees with a comprehensive tool for managing our current customers and their corresponding documentation. Employees can create customer profiles and within each customer's profile, add relevant documents like Low-Level Design and High-Level Design. This page also allows CCN employees to easily delete specific customers and their associated documents.</p>
            <h3>Main feature</h3>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">This page boasts the ability to generate Vue-Sphinx forms for each document. Users can simply click on the provided hyperlink, which redirects them to the corresponding Vue form. The Vue form then seamlessly converts the added files into Sphinx format, ultimately creating Read the Docs for each document.</p>
            <h3>In essence, our customer page serves as a centralized hub for customer and document management, simplifying the process of creating and accessing comprehensive documentation.</h3>
